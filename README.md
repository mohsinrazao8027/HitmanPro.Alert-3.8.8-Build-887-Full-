# HitmanPro.Alert-3.8.8-Build-887-Full-
Behavioral Detection: HitmanPro.Alert uses behavioral analysis to detect and block malware based on how it behaves in the system. This is especially useful for detecting new or unknown threats that might evade traditional signature-based detection.

Heuristic Detection: This method can detect suspicious activity or files that show signs of being malicious even if they donâ€™t have a known signature.

2. Ransomware Protection (CryptoGuard)
CryptoGuard is a powerful tool to stop ransomware from encrypting your files. It monitors your file system and, if it detects suspicious encryption activity (a hallmark of ransomware), it will block the process and restore any encrypted files to their previous state.

Automated Recovery: If files are encrypted or altered by ransomware, CryptoGuard automatically restores them to their unencrypted state. This prevents ransomware from causing permanent damage.

3. Exploit Mitigation
Exploit Protection: This feature blocks attacks that try to exploit software vulnerabilities (such as vulnerabilities in your browser, PDF reader, or Office applications). Exploits can give attackers unauthorized access to your system, and this feature prevents those kinds of attacks.
